### Hi there üëã

A little bit about me first. I am a graduate student with a passion for Deep Learning research and competitions. I have participated in IEEE VIPCUP and SPCUP as well as in Kaggle competitions where I have the rank of Competitions Master. Most of my experience is in Computer Vision and Multi-Modal applications but I am not one to shy away from other domains. Currently looking for exciting projects to be a part of! Gaining experience and contributing are my primary goals.
